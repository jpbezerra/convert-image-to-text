# About
- This is a repository made to store a code that converts each pixel of an image in a character by my choice.
- image.py: a python file that has the code to convert the image, it uses the module [Image](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html) of the library [PILLOW](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/); and also I used `os` to convert many files as I want, but it works if you want to convert one image per run.
- images-jpg: the images that will be converted.
- images-txt: the images in ascii characters, to visualize better open the notepad.

## Requirements
- To use the code, do: `pip install requirements.txt` and then you will be able to use the file image.py
